  <h1>Chicken Stir Fry</h1>

  <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>For this recipe, you can use whatever veggies and sauce you have on hand since this stir fry recipe is easily customizable. My personal favorites are green peppers and mushrooms with a teriyaki sauce.</p>

  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul> 
        <li>1 pound of boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1-2 green bell peppers</li>
        <li>one small yellow onion or several green onions</li>
        <li>8 oz mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/3 cup bottled teriyaki sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp fresh minced ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
 <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>First, mix the teriyaki sauce, vegetable oil, garlic, ginger, and black and red peppers in a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Next, clean the chicken breasts and cube them so they are similar bite sized pieces. Add the chicken to the metal bowl, stir, and cover for at least an hour (although more doesn't hurt--the longer the better, really!).</li>
        <li>While the chicken is marinating, you can prep the vegetables. The onion should be diced, and the bell peppers and mushrooms should also be in bite sized pieces. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is ready, heat a little vegetable oil in a deep pan or wok at medium heat. Once the pan is hot enough, add onions and cook until translucent</li>

    </ol>
