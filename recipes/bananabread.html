    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p> This recipe uses ingredients that one usually has in the home, like butter, eggs, salt, and flour. It also features overripe bananas for that classic, strong banana flavor and walnuts to even out the sweetness.</p>
    
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>2-3 overripe bananas</li>
          <li>1 1/4 cups unbleached all purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
          <li>2 large room temperature eggs</li>
          <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
          <li>4 tbsp unsalted room temperature butter</li>
          <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
          <li>3/4 cup chopped walnuts</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Farenheit and grease a loaf baking dish with butter or oil. </li>
          <li>First, combine the flour, salt, and baking soda in a medium mixing bowl</li>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the sugar and the butter until creamy.</li>
          <li>Once the sugar and butter mixture is ready, add the vanilla extract and eggs and stir until smooth</li>
          <li>Next, mash bananas with a fork in a separate small mixing bowl. Try to avoid as many clumps as you can.</li>
          <li>Add the smashed bananas to the large mixing bowl with the butter mixture and stir until smooth</li>
          <li>Slowly add the dry flour mixture to the butter and banana mixture and stir until combined. Once all flour mixture has been added, do not overmix! Mix only until major clumps are gone.</li>
          <li>Pour into prepared baking dish and bake for 55 minutes to an hour, or until loaf is golden and an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool completely before attempting to remove the loaf from the pan and slicing it.</li>
